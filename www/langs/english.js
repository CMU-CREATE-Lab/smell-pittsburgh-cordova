Foul odors outside can indicate symptoms of a serious pollution problem in our region. We, our children, our friends and families all breathe in this air. If our air smells toxic, then we are likely inhaling toxins.",

In 2017, we worked with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) around design and daily data sharing for Smell PGH. After further collaboration with ACHD, starting Dec 2021 we are sending to ACHD smell reports in bulk at the end of the day, together with daily aggregate geographic analyses of reports.",
