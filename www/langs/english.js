    p1: "Smell MyCity is a smartphone app designed to crowdsource reports of pollution odors travelling through our cities. All smell reports submitted through the app are visible on our map, and this information is publicly available through our website (smellmycity.org). Local residents, organizations and regulators can use smell report data to help track down potential sources of pollution in their neighborhood.",
    h2_2: "Why Focus on Smells?",
    p2: "Air quality is usually invisible to us; however, air pollution can have very real, long term impacts on our health and quality of life. Foul odors outside are typically symptoms of a serious pollution problem in our region. We, our children, our friends and families all breathe in this air. If our air smells toxic, then we are likely inhaling toxins.",
    h2_3: "Who Can Use Smell MyCity?",
    p3: "Anyone in the U.S. can submit a smell report through Smell MyCity! This app was designed for a national audience. Any community can use the Smell MyCity app to collectively document pollution odors in their neighborhood, and use that data to advocate for better air quality. We have worked closely with community partners in a few cities to connect smell report data from those locations to relevant local regulatory agencies. If you are interested in partnering with us to connect your community's data to local regulators, please contact us at: info@smellmycity.org",
    h2_4: "Where Was Smell MyCity Developed?",
    p4: "Smell MyCity was developed by the <a href='https://cmucreatelab.org' target='_blank'>CMU CREATE Lab</a>, as an extension of their Smell Pittsburgh (<a href='https://smellpgh.org' target='_blank'>Smell PGH</a>) app, which was deployed in 2016. Smell PGH has activated local residents, and provided the local health department with a higher resolution of pollution data to help track down potential sources. Given the successful implementation of this smell reporting app in Pittsburgh, the CREATE Lab developed the Smell MyCity app to bring this technology to residents across the U.S. Smell MyCity will be first piloted in Louisville, KY and Portland, OR, in collaboration with local advocacy and community groups.",
    p5: "Smell MyCity was developed with support from <a href='http://www.heinz.org/' target='_blank'>The Heinz Endowments</a>, which works toward building a Pittsburgh region that thrives as a whole and just community. The launch of Smell MyCity into cities across the U.S. is powered by <a href='https://www.seventhgeneration.com/insideSVG/mission' target='_blank'>Seventh Generation</a>, which is committed to <a href='https://www.seventhgeneration.com/action/climate-justice-equity' target='_blank'>Climate Justice & Equity</a> for the next seven generations and beyond. Thanks to these contributions, the Smell MyCity app will be made available to residents across the country, so that we all have an opportunity to join a larger, nationwide community of citizens actively documenting the human impacts of air pollution.",
    h2_5: "Smell MyCity Data",
    p6: "Anyone can access Smell MyCity data from our website: <a href='https://smellmycity.org' target='_blank'>smellmycity.org</a>.",
    p7: "We take every precaution to protect any personally identifiable data. All information shown on the public map visualization for Smell MyCity is anonymized and location data is skewed to protect your privacy. Personal contact information you enter in the settings tab is only made available to the relevant local regulatory agency. Our backend database only contains anonymous User ID's created by your app service (Apple or Google Play).",

For the past 30 years, Seventh Generation has been committed to using business as a force for good. The company partners with like-minded organizations, like CREATE Lab, to advocate for the rights of people and the planet because they believe that a company's values are as important as the products it makes. Seventh Generation knows that plant-based products can provide the efficacy you are looking for, and that products designed from renewable plant-based ingredients are a more sustainable option than ingredients made from petroleum. Above all, they believe that we have a responsibility to this generation and the next seven, and invite us all on their journey to nurture the health of the next seven generations.",
